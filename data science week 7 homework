1. How do you control for biases?
use random sampling or assignment, cross validation might also be a good way to check

2. What are confounding variables?
other variables that affect the experiment outside the independent variable, leading to less fair experiment

3. What is A/B testing?
Null hypothesis testing

4. When will you use Welch t-test?
when you want to compare the means of two independent groups when the assumption of equal variances is violated.

5.A company claims that the average time its customer service representatives spend on the phone per call is 6 minutes. You believe that the average time is actually higher. You collect a random sample of 50 calls and find that the average time spent on the phone per call in your sample is 6.5 minutes, with a standard deviation of 1.2 minutes. Test whether there is sufficient evidence to support your claim at a significance level of 0.05.
 calculated t value = 2.9 > critical value of 1.69
 there is sufficient evidence to prove my point is correct.

6. A researcher wants to determine whether there is a difference in the mean scores of two groups of students on a math test. Group A consists of 25 students who received traditional teaching methods, while Group B consists of 30 students who received a new teaching method. The average score for Group A is 75, with a standard deviation of 8, and the average score for Group B is 78, with a standard deviation of 7. Test whether there is a significant difference in the mean scores of the two groups at a significance level of 0.05.
